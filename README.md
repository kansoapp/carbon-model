## 1. Modeling attempt on the carbon footprint of a data center

For the sake of our estimation, we consider that the carbon footprint of a data center can be further subdivided in four different carbon footprints:
* Emissions from running the data center (including IT equipments, air conditioning and electrical losses). Here we exclude any emission from offices in the data center, emissions due to the commuting of employees going to the data center, ...
* Emissions from manufacturing IT equipments and air conditioners
* Emissions from transferring data from the data center to other data centers and to the internet
* Embodied emissions from building the data center
